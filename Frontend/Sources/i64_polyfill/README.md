This module is used to polyfill wasm import which have `i64` type in its signature.

If a browser (e.g. Safari) doesn't support BigInt, JavaScript can't interoperate WebAssembly's `i64` value with `Number`.

But WASI APIs have `i64` argument types and return type.

This module provide WASI APIs overloads to prevent importing from JavaScript. The overloads split `i64` arguments into pairs of `i32` and foward it into actual implementations.

This polyfill code is generated by [`i64-polyfill-gen`](https://github.com/kateinoigakukun/swiftwasm-pad/tree/master/Frontend/Tools).

```
$ swift run --package-path ./Tools/ i64-polyfill-gen .build/debug/SwiftWasmPad.wasm Sources/i64_polyfill/i64_polyfill.c web/i64_polyfill.js
